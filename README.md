BitmapViewer.lua and BITMAPVIEWER both need to be in SCRIPTS/TOOLS/ so you could launch it directly from menu. 
You can change images in BITMAPVIEWER folder with changing bitmap1 and bitmap2 with your two 64*64 monochrome (Bit depth needs to be 1).
Your image files still need to be named bitmap1 and bitmap2.
